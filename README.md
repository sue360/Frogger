# Frogger
A project to create my first arcade game



ReadMe - GA Project One: Frogger - 6 days

Description

I created this game as my first project for General Assembly’s software engineering immersive course. The project brief was to build a simple game integrating learning on the course so far, including JavaScript arrays, loops, functions, CSS and more.

I chose to build Frogger, a classic arcade game of avoiding obstacles and racing against a countdown timer to reach safety. I chose to build this game as it includes auto generated obstacles and offered the chance to practise working with timers in JavaScript. I will discuss the process, results, and key takeaways below.

Timeframe & Working Team

This was a solo project, my first major project working independently. I spent five days (excluding initial planning) completing this project.

Technologies Used

JavaScript
CSS
HTML

Brief

The project brief set out necessary features the final game needed to include, to serve as a minimum viable product (MVP). Beyond this, there were ways to enhance the gameplay experience, and to make the game more challenging, immersive and complex.

I’ve included snippets from the core brief below:

The idea of Frogger is to guide a family of frogs across a road, and a river to their homes at the top of the screen.
 
To make things more challenging there are numerous moving obstacles that the frogs must avoid to reach their destination.


 
## Requirements
 
* The game should be playable for one player.
* The obstacles should be auto generated.

Planning

Though I was keen to get started, particularly on the CSS, to see how the design ideas I’d visualised really looked on my screen, taking time beforehand helped greatly. Planning allowed me to think through the different stages of the build process I would need to budget time for. I had only 5 days to build this game, so every hour had to count. 

I started by setting up a system to keep track of key tasks. For this I made use of a Trello board to break the stages of my project into clear and manageable tasks, and to keep track of it all. During the build stage, this was particularly useful at the start of each day, to recall the progress I had made, and consider priorities for the day ahead.
